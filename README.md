Spark Variable Reader - Reads exposed variables from a Spark Core.
=====================

Requires deviceID and accessToken (duh).
Lists all available variables and lets you choose which to display.

This has been my first Android project, so looking at the source code may propably make you cringe and cry ;)
But it works and I'm rather proud of it.
Nonetheless, you'll very likely encounter some bugs or situations which could be handled better. Just be prepared.
